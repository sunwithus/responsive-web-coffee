            <p class="type">Cappuccino</p>
            <p class="desc">Cappuccino is one of those types of coffee that is shrouded in various misconceptions.

            <p class="type">Americano</p>
            <p class="desc">When the American soldiers were stationed in Italy during World War II, they were intimidated by the strong, full-bodied flavor of coffee consumed by the native coffee drinkers. As Americans are raised on drip coffee, the taste of concentrated strong coffee is unfamiliar to their tastes. Hence, they started adding water to dilute espresso, and the famous watery black drink was born and was named an Americano. To make an Americano, you need two cups. Pull a shot of espresso into one cup, put some hot water in the other cup, and pour the espresso into the water to get a dilute drink. You can see the light brown creamy substance on the top that retains the rich flavor of coffee oils.</p>

You can brew black coffee in almost any kind of coffee maker, such as in a French press using ground coffee and near-boiling water.</p>
